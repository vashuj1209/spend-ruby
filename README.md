# AI-Powered Complaint Categorization System with RAG Pipeline

## Overview

This project involves the development of an AI-driven system that processes text-based consumer complaints, categorizes them into product and sub-product categories, and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. The system is enhanced with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using a vector database to retrieve and compare similar complaints based on textual similarity.

**Why Ruby Card Founders Will Be Happy:**  
This project aligns with Ruby's commitment to leveraging AI for improved financial decision-making. By categorizing and analyzing consumer complaints, Ruby can gain valuable insights into customer issues, enhancing product offerings and customer satisfaction. The integration of a RAG pipeline and vector database reflects a cutting-edge approach, making it a valuable asset for Ruby's financial health monitoring tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Basic HTML/CSS for user input forms (if needed)
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails for rapid API development
- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage
  - **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus)** for RAG pipeline
- **AI Model:** OpenAI API or similar LLM for complaint categorization and summary generation
- **RAG Pipeline:** Integration with a vector database to retrieve similar complaints

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Ruby on Rails:**
  - Develop RESTful APIs for complaint submission, processing, and retrieval.
  - Integrate with OpenAI API for categorization and summary generation.
  - Store categorized complaints in PostgreSQL.

### AI Integration

- **OpenAI API:**
  - Use AI to analyze and categorize complaints into predefined product and sub-product categories.
  - Generate summaries or insights from the complaints.

### RAG Pipeline

- **Vector Database Integration:**
  - Store complaint vectors generated by the AI model in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus).
  - Implement a retrieval system to compare and fetch similar complaints based on vector similarity.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL:**
  - Store complaint data, categorized tags, and summaries.
  - Ensure relational data integrity and efficient querying.

- **Vector Database:**
  - Store high-dimensional complaint vectors for similarity searches.
  - Enable the RAG pipeline to retrieve and compare related complaints quickly.

### Deployment

- **Basic Setup:**
  - Deploy the Rails application to handle larger datasets.
  - Optimize the RAG pipeline for performance and reliability.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.
   - Set up the vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus).

2. **Develop the Rails Backend:**
   - Create RESTful APIs for complaint submission, processing, and retrieval.
   - Integrate with OpenAI API for categorization and summary generation.
   - Implement background jobs for processing complaints and storing vectors.

3. **Integrate the RAG Pipeline:**
   - Set up the vector database and connect it with the Rails application.
   - Develop a service to store vectors of complaints.
   - Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch and display similar complaints.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Perform unit and integration testing to ensure all components work together.
   - Validate the AI model’s categorization accuracy and the RAG pipeline's effectiveness.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on a suitable cloud platform.
   - Monitor performance and make adjustments as needed for scalability and efficiency.

## Additional Ideas

### Multimodal Complaint Analysis System

**Overview:**  
Develop a multimodal system that processes and categorizes consumer complaints in various formats—voice, text, images, and video. The system uses an agentic workflow where each module (voice, text, image, video) operates autonomously, processing the input and passing relevant insights to a central aggregator for unified categorization and storage.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Voice Processing:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or AssemblyAI
- **Text Processing:** OpenAI GPT-4 or similar LLM
- **Image Processing:** AWS Rekognition or Google Cloud Vision
- **Video Processing:** Google Cloud Video Intelligence
- **Central Aggregator:** Flask-based backend
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data, Elasticsearch for efficient retrieval
- **Deployment:** Docker and Kubernetes

### Real-Time Expense Tracker Dashboard

**Overview:**  
Develop a full-stack web application that allows Ruby Card users to track their expenses in real time. The dashboard features categorized spending, recent transactions, and budget management, providing users with valuable financial insights.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React
- **Deployment:** Docker and AWS
